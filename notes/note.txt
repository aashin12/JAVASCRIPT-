data types in js
----------------

generally there are 2 data types -
1 primitive datatype - immutable datatype - (Cannot be changed)
 - Creates a new value
 - Creates new memory allocation 

eg , x=hello
     x=Hello  can be reassigned but not be changed

     1 string - represents sequence of characters enclosed in single,double quotes
     2 number - represents both integer a well as floatig point numbers
     3 Boolean - represents logcal values (true or false)
     4 BigInt - represents larger number which comes outside the limit of number datatypes
     5 Null - reprents intensional absence of value
     6 undefined - variable is declared but value is not assigned
     7 symbol - generate unique identifiers
              - symbol()
              - basically used in creatng libraries and modules based on js
2 non-primitive datatype - mutable - (Can be changed)
 - Mutable data types allow modifications to their values without creating a new reference in memory.
 - Modifies existing value
     8 object - reprented using key:value pairs
     eg ; object,array,functions
