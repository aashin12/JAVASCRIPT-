object oriented programming system (Oops)
---------------------------------------

its a programing paradigm which consider real time entities into objects and class.

basic 
-----
class - Blueprint which contains common features from which different objects can be created 
object - its a real time entity created from class
reference - The memory location in which properties and methods are stored.

proprties - variables inside a class 
methods - functions inside a class
instance variable 

syntax
------

class classname{
    1,properties 
    2,constructors - used to initialize properties 
    3,methods
}

syntax 
------
const objectname = new classname() //instance or object is created 

it is not mandatory to place properties ,methods and constructors together in every class 

this - instance variable 

pillars of oops 
--------------
1,Inheritance
 - Used to access properties and methods from one class to another
 - Parent class/super class/base class
 - Child class/sub class/derived class
 - keyword - extends 
 - Types - simple,multilevel,


 object Inheritance 
 ------------------
 keyword = __proto__

2,Polymorphism - 
3,Abstraction
4,Encapsulation
